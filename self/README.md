# self replication

Code that produces itself when called upon to produce output.

Two approaches:
1. Use meta information available to the system that runs the code.
2. The code constructs its own source.

## URL

1. `url-meta.krl`
2. `url.krl`

## KRL

1. `meta.krl`
2. `self-first.krl` and `self.krl`

The last of these is described in more detail in an external document, 
"[self evaluation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qBzetm0aIihK1H6IANw9s72MlgPvyc15Z_DwlZm6z08/edit?usp=sharing)".
