# Unit Tests

There are many reasons for unit tests.
Two that come to mind:

1. Regression testing, to ensure that code changes haven't broken something that used to work.
2. Test-driven development (TDD), in which one writes a test _first_, it fails, and then one fixes the code so that it passes. The test then joins the other regression unit tests.
